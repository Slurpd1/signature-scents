# signature-scents
A practice website using pure HTML and CSS. I am making this project as I follow the curriculum of the odin project. I have some new tools I would like to test such as flexbox. I've added a small personal twist to this website and I'll be making it about mens fragrances so maybe you can learn something while seeing my technical skills ;)
